##Music, a brief introduction
Music is mathematical endeavor as well as an artistic one. Sounds are simply frequencies. What we call music is an arrangement of those frequencies into a recognizable and pleasing way.

The human range of hearing is 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz. All music that we can hear is stuffed within that range. Nearly every musical instrument fits in that range as well. (A notable exception is the pipe organ, the largest ones reach below the range of human hearing, but at that range the deep bass notes are felt rather than heard.)

When a note is plucked on a guitar or struck on keyboard we are hearing a particular frequency. Modern orchestras tune their "A" note to 440 hertz. Sometimes this is abbreviated to A=440. This is known as the 'fundamental'. In addition to a fundamental, an instrument will produce a number of other frequencies. These are known as 'overtones'. The profile of overtones is what makes an oboe sound like an oboe and not an electric guitar.
